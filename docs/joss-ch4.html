    <h2>Math Objects</h2>
    
    <p>The following words and phrases are called MATH objects:</p>
    
    <table>
        <tr><td><em>step</em> —</td><td><em>all steps</em></td><td><em>part</em> —</td><td><em>all parts</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><em>form</em> —</td><td><em>all forms</em></td><td><em>formula</em> —</td><td><em>all formulas</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td><em>all</em> (everything)</td><td><em>all values</em> (values of all stored letters)</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>These objects may be deleted, typed, or stored. (See <em>Delete</em>, <em>Type</em>, <em>Store</em>.) The dashes may be filled with a specific number or with an expression that computes a number or formula identifier.</p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt><em>users</em>:</dt>
        <dd>This is the number of MATH consoles in use, not just those computing (not available at all locations).</dd>
        
        <dt><em>time</em>:</dt>
        <dd>This is actual 24-hour clock time at the computer center.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>Note that <em>users</em> and <em>time</em> appear only in <em>Type</em> commands.</p>

    <h2>Do</h2>
    
    <p>This is the primary verb that initiates a computation. Upon completion of what the Do has ordered, control is returned to the point just after that <em>Do</em>. If <em>Do</em> is given as a direct command, then control is returned to you. If it is stored, control returns to the step just after the <em>Do</em> step in the same part, and computation continues. <em>Do</em> can order either a single step or a part to be executed. Only the <em>Do</em> command can be modified by a <em>for</em> phrase. (See page 35.)</p>
    
    <p><em>Do</em> is interpreted only once. At that time, all values specified by expressions in the <em>for</em> phrase are calculated using current letter values and are saved. Hence, you cannot change the execution range of <em>Do</em> by giving new values to the letters in a <em>for</em> phrase range, as in FORTRAN. See <em>Done</em>/<em>Quit</em> (Page 27) for escape methods.</p>
    
    <p>Any <em>if</em> clauses modifying <em>Do</em> commands are interpreted only when the <em>Do</em> is first met, so that the <em>if</em> condition does not apply during the subsequent repetitions over the set of values specified by the <em>for</em> phrase.</p>

    <h2>Done/Quit</h2>
    
    <p>The <em>Do</em> command will normally be executed for the successive values in the set given by the <em>for</em> phrase. If a <em>Done</em> statement is reached in this execution, nothing specified farther on in the program will be done for the current value being processed. However, the remaining values will be processed. If a <em>Quit</em> statement is reached, neither the current value nor any of the remaining values will be further processed. <em>Done</em> and <em>Quit</em> may have an <em>if</em> clause. In this case the above behavior with respect to the current value and subsequent values is subject to that condition. In MATH, each part is provided automatically with an implied <em>Done</em> command as its last step. That is, as each current value being processed reaches this step, nothing further is done with it. <em>Quit</em> but not <em>Done</em>, may be used directly.</p>

    <h2>Stop/Cancel/End</h2>
    
    <p><em>Stop</em> is programmed interrupt (stored only) that returns control to you. This permits some operator action. A subsequent <em>Go</em> command will resume computation at the step following the <em>Stop</em> step.</p>
    
    <p><em>Cancel</em> may only be used directly. The machine's knowledge of current position in the computation is erased, without destroying either values computed up to that point or the program itself. A <em>Do</em> command is needed to restart the computation. A new <em>Do</em> command alone would achieve the same erasure and would start a new computation. But if you are space limited (See page 39), <em>Cancel</em> will give you back maneuver space and let you restart after corrections and insertion of new values. It is a rarely used verb.</p>
    
    <p><em>End</em> is used to terminate a MATH session. It may be given directly or stored. DOS/MATH termination differs from CTS/MATH termination.</p>

    <p>This command continues computation in progress after a programmed or manual interruption, as if the interruption had not occurred. Interruptions may occur because of (1) an error message, (2) pressing ATTN button, or (3) a programmed <em>Stop</em> verb. During the interruption, program or values may be modified as desired. If no computation was in progress (although you may have thought so) <em>Go</em> will produce the <em>I have nothing to do.</em> message. <em>Go</em> can only be used after MATH says he is somewhere.</p>

    <h2>Set</h2>
    
    <p>This is a replacement operation that assigns a new value -- given on the right of the equals sign -- to the identifier named on the left (a letter or an indexed letter). <em>Set</em> can be direct or indirect. In the direct mode, the word <em>Set</em> and the terminal period may be omitted. <em>Set</em> computes the right-hand expression just once and stores the value at a given place, named on the left-hand side. For indexed letters, values corresponding to each integral index are correspondingly stored in places named by the left-hand side. Note that indices can play the role of subscripts. (See page 33 for the important distinction between <em>Let</em> and <em>Set</em>.) Note that, say, the order <em>Type A.</em> will produce all values of <em>A</em> if <em>A</em> is an indexed letter.</p>

    <h2>Let</h2>
    
    <p>This command is used to define functions, called "formulas" in MATH, of at most 10 variables (called "parameters" in error messages). <em>Let</em> defines a rule for computation that is invoked each time the function is referenced. Unlike <em>Set</em>, the value computed is not stored but is used transiently. The rule, like <em>Set</em>, are dummies--they do not affect the values of stored letters "parameters" are some names. (The command <em>Set f(x)=3.</em> requires x to be an integer, with the some since we are naming a storage place, by the letter and the index.) |x|≤250, since we are naming a storage place, by the letter and the index.)</p>
    
    <p><em>Let</em> is normally used directly since the defined function is usually employed in the program as a whole. It is used indirectly when in the course of the program the function is to be redefined (thus erasing the previous definition).</p>
    
    <p><em>Let</em> can be used to abbreviate an expression (e.g., <em>Let s=sqrt(x↑2+y↑2).</em>). In this case where s is needed, current stored values of x and y will be used. If there is no stored x, MATH will say, <em>Error in formula s: x = ???</em> when you type <em>x=1</em>, this becomes a stored value. On the other hand, <em>Let s(x,y)=</em> sqrt(x↑2+y↑2), permits calling via s(1,8). As explained above, x,y are now dummies, and stored values are not affected.</p>

    <p>This word may be used to qualify any command. It specifies the conditions under which the imperative will be executed. These conditions may contain logical and algebraic expressions. In examining a command with an <em>if</em> clause, MATH first evaluates the condition in that clause. When the condition is not met, the command is not processed in any way. Thus the command could be in error and the error not detected until the condition is finally met. (See also examples under <em>Do</em>, page 24.)</p>

    <p>This is a stored command only. The order allows the program to call for values to be typed in by the user, thus minimizing the amount of typing to be done, systematizing inputs, and avoiding failures to input needed data. MATH types out the requested letter, which may be indexed, and an equals sign. The user types the desired value or expression to the right. If the user terminates his input line with an asterisk, the line is ignored and the <em>Demand</em> request is made again. If the user's response is improper formed, MATH returns an appropriate error message and makes the request again. If the user hits RETURN only, MATH considers it to be an interrupt and returns control to the user with an appropriate message.</p>
    
    <p>If the <em>Demand</em> command is followed by the word <em>as</em> and a string of text in quotes, MATH will type the quoted text followed by an equals sign to identify the requested value.</p>

    <h2>Sparse</h2>
    
    <p>This term is used only in the command <em>Let A be sparse.</em>, where <em>A</em> is the name of an array with up to 10 indices. When <em>A</em> is declared sparse and values have been given to some of the array's elements, MATH considers all other elements to be zero. If a new <em>A</em> is entered with a different number of indices, the old <em>A</em> is erased and the new <em>A</em> must be redeclared sparse. Inputting elements is a <em>Set</em> operation, and hence only these elements are stored. The command corresponds to <em>Let</em>, in that nonstored elements are "computed" to be zero. Hence <em>sparse</em> saves storage space and inputting effort.</p>

    <h2>Form</h2>
    
    <p>A <em>form</em> describes how you want your output to appear. In the body of the program, the order is: <em>Type "list" in form n.</em>. The "list" is usually a set of letters or expressions, separated by commas, whose values will be typed out following the form's layout. The form number <em>n</em> is an integer (1≤<em>n</em>&lt;10⁹) but may be an expression whose value will be computed.</p>
    
    <p>Forms are typed directly. The first line is simply <em>Form n:</em>. The second line is a set of fields and/or internal information, spaced as desired.</p>
    
    <p>A field is a string of underscores, perhaps with a decimal point, or a string of periods. Values will fill these fields in the order specified, rounded as necessary. All other characters in the form are typed out exactly as they were typed in (including asterisk).</p>
    
    <p>The number of underscores to the right of a decimal point indicates the desired roundoff. The number of underscores to the left must be adequate to hold the expected integer part of computed values, including a minus sign. It is usually simplest to be generous. A field of periods will be filled by the value in scientific notation. The minimum field of 7 periods will give just two significant digits. The first period is reserved for the sign of the value, and the third from the end is reserved for the sign of the exponent.</p>
    
    <p>Forms without fields are useful to output headings, messages, and the like. In this case, the second line of the form definition is the desired text and the command is simply <em>Type form n.</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Line</em>. advances paper one line, leaving a blank. (See also page 37.) <em>Page</em>. advances paper to start a new page. <em>Head</em>. begins a new page on the next line. These commands can be used to improve output format. The format can be programmed by appending <em>if Line and Page</em>. The symbol $ has as value the current line number on the page (1 to 54--the heading line is for administrative use only). The symbol $ is often used in <em>if</em> clauses for format control purposes.</p>

    <h2>Store/Delete/Get</h2>
    
    <p>All file commands may be direct or stored.</p>
    
    <p>The commands to enter material in your file are <em>Store "list" as "name"</em> or <em>Store "list" replacing "name"</em>. The "list" consists of MATH objects (See page 23.) and/or letters identifying values, arrays, or formulas. You may choose a "name" of from four to fifteen letters and/or digits. The "name" may include an integer-valued index in the range [-250,250]. In the case of <em>Store ... replacing ...</em>, MATH assigns the specified name to the newly stored item and then deletes the old item of that name.</p>
    
    <p>To erase an item from your file the command is <em>Delete "name"</em>. (See also page 31.)</p>
    
    <p>You can get a copy of an item from your file, from the library or from another file. Since it is a copy, you can manipulate or modify the item as you wish. The commands are <em>Get "name"</em>, <em>Get "name" from library.</em>, and <em>Get "name" from file "number"</em>. (See page 45 for "number".) After <em>Get</em>, you can use <em>Type</em> commands to examine the item.</p>

    <h2>Chaining</h2>
    
    <p>It is also possible to "chain" subprograms or data held in separate items and needed for a large problem. You will not run out of space or mix part numbers provided sufficient care is taken in programming the chain's housekeeping. (See page 65.)</p>
    
    <h2>File Warning</h2>
    
    <p>Getting file material is equivalent to typing in the filed material from a console during the same session. Hence step numbers, values, etc. from the item replace similarly numbered or named ones previously typed in. It is good practice to <em>Delete all.</em> before recalling an item. Otherwise, an appalling confusion of steps can result. Manipulations of files and items can be done indirectly by program, and this is most useful.</p>
    
    <p>File access time may vary from a few seconds to minutes, depending essentially on the number of users queuing for file access. An impatient interrupt will send you back to the end of the queue.</p>

    <h2>Parenthetic Computation</h2>
    
    <p>Sometimes in the course of a calculation (say, at an interrupt point or an error message) it is convenient to perform a second calculation (to identify an error) without disturbing the one in progress. This may be accomplished by a parenthetic <em>Do</em>--a <em>Do</em> command enclosed in parentheses, process may be carried out indefinitely (subject to storage limits). The parenthetic <em>Cancel</em>. cancels the current subexecution, and the primary execution may then be resumed. Note that new values so computed for letters will remain after the parenthetic computation.</p>
