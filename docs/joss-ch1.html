    <h1>I. Introduction</h1>
    
    <p>MATH(JOSS) is a problem solver for people who are not programmers and who do not wish to become programmers.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>MATH can be used for desk calculator work.</li>
        <li>MATH can be used to perform standard tasks for which programs are available in a growing library.</li>
        <li>MATH can be used to solve problems through use of the powerful JOSS* command language.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can become acquainted with MATH right at a terminal. See page 3 for information on how to take the MATH lessons.</p>
    
    <h2>Desk Calculator</h2>
    
    <p>Here are some examples of MATH being used as a desk calculator. What you key is in green. MATH's responses are in black.</p>
    
    <div class="code-block"><span class="user-input">Type 2+2.</span>
        2+2 =           4
<span class="user-input">Set x=3.</span>

        x =             3

        x+2 =           5
        x-2 =           1
        2·x =           6
        x/2 =           1.5

    <h2>Library Programs</h2>
    
    <p>Programs which perform many standard tasks can be found in the MATH library. To see a list of those currently available, you key <span class="user-input">Type library summary.</span></p>
    
    <p>Illustrated below is the loan amortization program. You enter the amount of the loan ($3200), the interest rate (7.9%), and the repayment period (12 months). MATH(JOSS) indicates that the monthly payments are $278.22 and then types out a table showing how much of each installment goes to pay interest and how much to reduce the debt.</p>
    
    <div class="code-block"><span class="user-input">Get loan from library.</span>
Done.
<span class="user-input">Do part 1.</span>

        MATH Loan Amortization Calculation

Please enter the following information:

The amount of the loan = 3200
The annual interest rate in percent (e.g., 6.5) = 7.9
The term of the loan in months = 12
The number of the month of the first payment (1 = Jan., etc.) = 4
The year of the first payment (1966, etc.) = 1968

Amount:   3200.00; Rate:   7.90; Term: 12 months; Payments: 278.22

    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
    
    <p>Perhaps you are interested in right triangles. You know that the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides (c²=a²+b²).</p>
    
    <p>You key in a few steps:</p>
    
    <div class="code-with-comments">
        <div class="code-block"><span class="user-input">1.1 Do part 2 for b=1(1)a.
2.1 Set c=sqrt(a*2+b*2).
2.2 Type a, b, c in form 1.

    <p>What you want is a list of those right triangles which have integral sides.</p>
    
    <p>You modify your solution:</p>

2.2 Type a, b, c in form 1 if fp(c)=0.
Type part 2.
2.1 Set c=sqrt(a*2+b*2).

2.2 Type a, b, c in form 1 if fp(c)=0.
Do part 1 for a=1(1)12.</span>
