- headings should be title-cased, as the h1/h2/h3 styling will handle
  the uppercasing
- use the .code-with-comments class to represent comments,
  make sure to use this to associate comments with particular lines
  (do not use <br> to align comments)
- retain italics (using <em>) and green text (using class .user-input)
- make sure that interpuncts and asterisks are accurately represented
- change < into &lt; when generating this symbol to avoid breaking the
  HTML
- if there's a diagram on the right hand side, try to represent it
  as an SVG
